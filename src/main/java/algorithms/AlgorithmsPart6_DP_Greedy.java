		- Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem by breaking it into
		    sub-problems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again.

		- two main properties of a problem that suggests that the given problem can be solved using Dynamic programming:
			1) Optimal Substructure
			2) Overlapping Sub-problems

	 Greedy
	 	- At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution of the
	 	    complete problem.

	 	- Applications:
	 		Activity selection problem
	 		Prim's
	 		Kruskal
	 		Dijkstra
	 		Huffman coding
